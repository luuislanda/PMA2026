# How to Submit Your Exam/Assignment 

Please follow these steps carefully to ensure your file is small enough to upload and includes all necessary components.

## 0. Save your work and check the submission requirements

Make sure you are about to upload the latest verion of your work, it's a good idea to save your work one last time before uploading.

Also, check the submission checklist provided in your Assignment/Exam and ensure you have everything that's needed/

## 1. Create a "Submission Copy"

Just in case we have to modify things, it's a good idea to work on a copy.

Make a copy of your work, and then begin to work on that "submission copy"

## 2. Delete the node_modules Folder

This step is extremely important when submitting the exam, please follow it to avoid us all having issues due to file sizes!

The `node_modules` folder inside your code project contains the "engine" that runs React Native. It is very heavy (often 200MB+) and we do not need it for grading.

- Open your newly created submission folder (the copy you made in Step 1).

- Locate the folder named node_modules.

- Delete it (Right-click → Delete or Move to Trash).

> OBS: Your app will not run from this folder once node_modules is gone. This is normal! And why we made a copy. When grading, we will reinstall the modules on our end to grade it.

## 3. Zip Your Folder

Now that your folder is ready, containing only App.js, your assets folder, and configuration files, we can zip it.

### On Windows
1. Right-click on your submission folder (assignment1-code).
2. Choose Send to > Compressed (zipped) folder.
3. A new file ending in .zip will appear. This is your submission file.

### On macOS
1. Right-click on your submission folder (assignment1-code).
2. Select Compress "Name_Surname_Assignment1".
3. A new file ending in .zip will appear. This is your submission file.

#### Naming your file 

Also very important for exam submissions! 

- Please name the file using this format with your ITU credentials. 

"ituemail"-"assignment+number/exam"-"pma2026"

Here are some examples:

`luil-assignment1-pma2026.zip`
`luil-exam-pma2026.zip`
