# Programming Mobile Applications 2026

Welcome to the official Github repo for the Programming Mobile Applications Class of Spring 2026 at ITU.

## This repo and the course

> [!WARNING]
> There is nothing in this repository that is not available in LearnIT!

So you do not need to be here at all if it's something you find too intimidating.

I use Git myself to keep track of things and also because I believe in open source :). It also allows for much faster document editing, meaning updates to things like the cheatsheet will be much easier to manage.

So once again, if you find Git confusing or too annoying to handle, remember everything here will be in LearnIT.

All of that said, if you find the programming part interesting and something you'd like to do in the future, Git is an industry standard and learning it is very recommended :) 

## How to use this repo 

This repo will evolve over time, for now the structure is simple.

Inside the sessions folders, you will find each session for the course. 

There you will find the source code for the slides and eventually the code for each session as well as the exercise
